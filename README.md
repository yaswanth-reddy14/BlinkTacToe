# Blink Tac Toe 

A unique twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game where emojis appear and disappear! Built with React and modern web technologies.

##  Features

- **Dynamic Emoji Categories**: Players choose from 6 themed categories:
  -  Animals: üê∂ üê± üê≠ üêπ üê∞ ü¶ä üêª üêº üê®
  -  Food: üçï üçî üçü üå≠ üçø üßÅ üç© üç¶ üçì
  -  Sports: ‚öΩ üèÄ üèà ‚öæ üéæ üèê üèâ üé± üèì
  -  Nature: üå∏ üåπ üå∫ üåª üå¥ üåµ üçÑ üåç ‚≠ê
  -  Travel: ‚úàÔ∏è üöó üöÇ üö¢ üöÅ üèñÔ∏è üóΩ üóø üè∞
  -  Faces: üòÄ üòé ü§î üòç ü•≥ üò¥ ü§Ø üòá ü•∫

- **Vanishing Mechanic**: Each player can only have 3 emojis on the board at once. When placing a 4th emoji, the oldest one disappears (FIFO - First In, First Out). This creates an interesting strategic element where players must consider both placement and timing.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18**: Built with functional components and modern hooks
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and beautiful UI design
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds
- **Lucide React**: For minimal, beautiful icons

##  Implementation Details

### Vanishing Feature Implementation

The vanishing mechanic is implemented through:

1. **Timestamp Tracking**: Each placed emoji stores its placement timestamp
2. **FIFO Queue**: Player emojis are managed in an array with position and timestamp
3. **Automatic Removal**: When placing a 4th emoji:
   - The oldest emoji is identified by timestamp
   - Removed from both the board and player's emoji array
   - The cell becomes available again

Key code from `gameLogic.ts`:
```typescript
if (newPlayerEmojis[currentPlayer].length >= 3) {
  const oldestIndex = getOldestEmojiIndex(newPlayerEmojis[currentPlayer]);
  if (oldestIndex !== -1) {
    const oldestPosition = newPlayerEmojis[currentPlayer][oldestIndex].position;
    newBoard[oldestPosition] = null;
    newPlayerEmojis[currentPlayer].splice(oldestIndex, 1);
  }
}
```

##  Future Improvements

Given more time, these features would enhance the game:

1. **Online Multiplayer**
   - Real-time gameplay using WebSocket
   - Player matchmaking
   - Game rooms

2. **Enhanced Animations**
   - Smooth transitions for emoji placement/removal
   - Victory line animations
   - Category selection effects

3. **Game Modes**
   - Single-player vs AI
   - Custom emoji category creation
   - Timed matches

4. **Persistence**
   - Save game statistics
   - Player profiles
   - Achievement system

5. **Accessibility**
   - Screen reader support
   - Keyboard navigation
   - High contrast mode

##  How to Play

1. Each player selects an emoji category
2. Take turns placing emojis on the 3x3 grid
3. Remember: only 3 emojis per player can exist at once
